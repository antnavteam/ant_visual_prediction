# Ants integrate proprioception, visual context and efference copies to make robust predictions

## Description

This repository contains the data and codes necessary to obtain the results from the article "Ants integrate proprioception, visual context and efference copies to make robust predictions" by O. Dauzere-Peres & A. Wystrach (2023).
The raw data files used were collected by a virtual reality set-up running with Unity 2020.1 (free software) envrironment controlling the rotation of the scene projected on an LED screen around an ant mounted on a trackball. Raw data consists of the movements of the ants on the ball, which were obtained by two sensors quantifying the movement of the ball along the three axis.
